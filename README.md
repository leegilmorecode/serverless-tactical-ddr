# A tactical approach to serverless DoR & DoD

When it comes to building out serverless architectures, one of the main benefits of getting started is how easy it is, and one of the biggest downsides is also how easy it is!

Teams can very quickly build out scalable MVPs (_Minimum Viable Products_) using AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB, but the downside of this is that many teams forget how to correctly productionise these solutions, and miss really key factors that end up biting them at a later date!
